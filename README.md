# sho_util
This repository contains the python functions for my own usage. Since it is painstaking to put some common functions into every repository, I thought it is a good idea to create the repository for the functions that can be used in other research. 
# To add this repository as a submodule
```bash
git submodule add -b main git@github.com:shinshoji01/sho_util.git
```
# When you clone the repository that includes a submodule
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
